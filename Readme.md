lua-Utilities
==========

A small collection of lua functions split into cathegories. Each module is fully self-contained and does not depend on any external library.

##Adding you your [existing] project
* Add the library to your git project. Clone it, or use it as a submodule:
```bash
  git submodule add git@github.com:it-s/lua-Utilities.git
```
##Initializing the module
* Include it into your project:
```lua
  local Utils = require "lua-Utilities.[Library Name]"
```
